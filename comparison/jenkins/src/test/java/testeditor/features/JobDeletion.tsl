Feature: Job deletion on Jenkins
	As an awesome DevOps engineer
	I want to be able to delete previously created Jenkins jobs
	in order to run save some memory and keep my instance clean.
	
Scenario: Delete Jenkins job
	* Given a previously created job named "job-rest"
	* When I delete the job "job-rest"
	* Then I expect it no longer exists
